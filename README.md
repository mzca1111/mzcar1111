# Hello! Welcome to my portfolio and storage hub for my code. I started out coding in python by completing the PCEP - Certified Entry Level Python Programmer from the Python Insitute in February 2023. I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Biomedical Engineering from Wichtia State University in May 2022. My current focus within python is data analysis. I completed the Sports Performace Analysis certificate from Coursera and University of Michigan in June 2023. I am currently pivoting towards sports analysis specifically in soccer (football if you like) and F1. I am currently working through the Soccermatics coursework as well as FCPython and Medium's guide to analyzing F1 data (all are linked in their repsective folders). Thanks for reading and feel free to reach out to me with comments about my code or projects!

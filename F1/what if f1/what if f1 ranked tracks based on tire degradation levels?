What if F1 ranked tracks based on tire degradation levels?

As with most things in F1, there is no definitive best or worst, easiest or hardest. Everything is situational and dependent on a multiple of factors. But keeping most variables constant, here is a list of tracks from 
highest to lowest tire deg. Street circuits were ranked lower. Circuits with high speed corners were ranked higher. I also took into account what races Pirelli brought the hardest tire compounds too. 

Bahrain(hardest tire compounds) 
Silverstone-Suzuka (Japan)-Qatar
Miami
Hungary-Spain-Zandvoort (Netherlands)
Austin-SPA
Brazil-Qatar-Jeddah (Saudi Arabia)(hardest tire compounds)
Albert Park (Australia)-Mexico-Austria-Abu Dhabi
Marina Bay(Singapore) 
Las Vegas-Monza-Baku(Azerbaijan) 
Montreal-Monaco

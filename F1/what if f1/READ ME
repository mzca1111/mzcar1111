# Hello! In these files you will find the posts, code, and diagrams or images of all of my what if f1 posts. Again, I stress I am just starting out with both data analytics and doing it specifically related to f1. 
# Each post is split into the folder with the name of the question I asked.
# All purely speculative, with no hurt or harm intended. As I do not have access to the same resources and data that the teams and drivers do, I must make quite a few simplifications.
# I am striving for progress not perfection :)
# I also do not own any of the data or anything related to f1, the FIA, the teams, the drivers, etc,. This is solely for educational purposes and for fun. Constructive feedback is always appreciated.

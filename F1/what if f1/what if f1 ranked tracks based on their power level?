What if F1 ranked tracks based on their power level? 

With power tracks, long straights and short, slow corners are more prevalent because they allow the cars to get to higher speeds. Engine power, acceleration, and top speeds play a bigger role than downforce in these 
circuits. 

Highest to lowest(1):
Monza - ultimate power track
Saudi Arabia
Montreal-Zandvoort
SPA-Azerbaijan(Baku)-Bahrain 
Qatar-Austria
Suzuka
Abu Dhabi-Austin
Spain-Miami 
Brazil-Hungary-Australia -Silverstone
Mexico
Singapore
Monaco 

Wild card: Las Vegas, supposedly this track will be close to the speeds shown at Monza which would make it a higher power track. Some predictions say it will be the second fastest circuit on the calendar from Saudi 
Arabiaâ€™s race (2).
